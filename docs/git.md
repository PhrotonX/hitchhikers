# Working with Git

**Note:** You can use the Source Control tab on VS Code in place of commands.
## To begin contributing
Make sure that you are switched to a dev branch by performing the following command on the terminal:

git checkout dev
```

Create a branch for each feature. To create a branch based on the currently checked-out branch, perform the following command:
```
git checkout -b feature/branch_name.
```
You are supposed to create a branch for each feature (e.g. login frontend, login backend, fix for login, etc.).
